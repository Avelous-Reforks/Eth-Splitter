# Professional Experience - SplitETH

## Recommended Version (Tailored for Sticker Mule)

**Architected and developed SplitETH, a production-grade multi-chain payment distribution platform built with TypeScript and Next.js.** Designed and deployed secure smart contracts supporting ETH and ERC20 token splits across Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism networks. Built a full-stack web application featuring bulk recipient management, contact storage with CSV import/export, transaction history tracking via GraphQL queries, and shareable configuration links. Implemented robust input validation, duplicate detection, and real-time balance calculations. Integrated Ponder (GraphQL) with PostgreSQL for efficient blockchain event indexing and querying. The platform processes over $20,000 in monthly transactions and serves users requiring precise multi-recipient payment distributions.

## Alternative Versions

### Version 1: Technical Focus

**Engineered SplitETH, a multi-chain payment distribution platform using TypeScript, Next.js, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL.** Developed secure Solidity smart contracts deployed across multiple L2 networks (Arbitrum, Base, Optimism) for ETH and ERC20 token distribution. Built comprehensive frontend with recipient management, contact storage, transaction history, and shareable split configurations. Implemented GraphQL API using Ponder for blockchain event indexing with PostgreSQL backend, enabling efficient querying of historical transaction data. Added features including bulk address import, CSV export, duplicate detection, and real-time validation. Platform processes $20,000+ monthly in distributed payments.

**Why this works:** Emphasizes technical stack alignment (TypeScript, GraphQL, Postgres) and demonstrates full-stack capabilities.

### Version 2: Product/Platform Focus

**Built SplitETH, a multi-chain payment distribution platform that simplifies complex payment workflows for teams and organizations.** Architected the full-stack solution using TypeScript, Next.js, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL, enabling users to distribute ETH and tokens across multiple recipients with equal or custom splits. Developed smart contracts supporting multi-chain deployments and built a user-friendly interface with contact management, transaction history, and shareable configuration links. Implemented GraphQL-based event indexing system for efficient transaction querying and analytics. The platform handles $20,000+ in monthly transaction volume, demonstrating production-scale reliability.

**Why this works:** Emphasizes platform building and user-focused product development, aligning with Sticker Mule's Stores/Give/Ship suite approach.

### Version 3: Impact-Focused

**Developed SplitETH, a production payment distribution platform processing $20,000+ monthly across multiple blockchain networks.** Built end-to-end using TypeScript, Next.js, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL, featuring secure smart contracts for ETH and ERC20 token splits. Created comprehensive web application with bulk recipient management, contact storage, transaction history tracking, and shareable configurations. Implemented GraphQL API with PostgreSQL for efficient blockchain data indexing and querying. Platform serves users requiring precise multi-recipient payment distributions with robust validation and error handling.

**Why this works:** Leads with impact ($20k/month), then demonstrates technical depth and full-stack capabilities.

### Version 4: Concise Version

**Architected SplitETH, a multi-chain payment distribution platform (TypeScript, Next.js, GraphQL, PostgreSQL) processing $20,000+ monthly.** Designed secure smart contracts for ETH/ERC20 splits across Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism. Built full-stack application with bulk recipient management, contact storage, transaction history via GraphQL, and shareable configurations. Integrated Ponder with PostgreSQL for efficient blockchain event indexing.

**Why this works:** Concise format suitable for resume space constraints while highlighting key technologies and impact.
