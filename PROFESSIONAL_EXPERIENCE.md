# Professional Experience Description

## Option 1: Comprehensive (Recommended)

**Architected and developed SplitETH, a production-grade multi-chain payment distribution platform built with TypeScript and Next.js. Designed and deployed secure smart contracts supporting ETH and ERC20 token splits across Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism networks. Built a full-stack web application featuring bulk recipient management, contact storage, transaction history tracking, and shareable configuration links. Implemented robust input validation, duplicate detection, and real-time balance calculations. The platform processes over $20,000 in monthly transactions and serves users requiring precise multi-recipient payment distributions.**

## Option 2: Concise

**Built SplitETH, a multi-chain payment distribution platform using TypeScript and Next.js. Designed secure smart contracts deployed across three blockchain networks (Arbitrum, Base, Optimism) supporting ETH and token splits. Developed a full-stack web application with bulk import, contact management, and transaction history features. Platform processes $20,000+ in monthly transactions.**

## Option 3: Impact-Focused

**Developed SplitETH, a production payment distribution platform processing $20,000+ monthly in transactions. Architected secure smart contracts and built a TypeScript/Next.js web application supporting multi-chain deployments (Arbitrum, Base, Optimism). Implemented features including bulk recipient management, contact storage, transaction tracking, and shareable configurations. Designed for users requiring precise, transparent multi-recipient payment distributions.**

## Option 4: Technical Skills Emphasis

**Full-stack TypeScript developer: Architected SplitETH, a multi-chain payment distribution platform. Designed secure Solidity smart contracts with reentrancy protection and input validation, deployed across Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism. Built Next.js 15 application with React 19, implementing bulk CSV import, contact management, transaction history, and real-time validation. Platform handles $20,000+ in monthly transactions with production-grade reliability.**
